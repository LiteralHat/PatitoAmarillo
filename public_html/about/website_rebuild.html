            <h2 class="questions">What happened to the old website?</h2>
            <p>It's been retired, so unfortunately you won't see it again. If you miss it, visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/literalhat.com">Wayback Machine</a> as I archived it from the very start.</p>
            <h2 class="questions">Why are you rebuilding the website?</h2>
            <p>Numerous issues:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The file structure of the site was a mess. No naming conventions were used. In other words, if you wanted to embed an image (such as an artwork) directly from my site onto your forum / myspace / etc. and I decided to move or modify the image, it would often break and you'd have to manually embed it again.</li>
            <li>It was not very mobile / web responsive. Things would scale wrong and look broken across different devices and browsers. Styling was inconsistent. For example link colors would be red on one page but default blue on others.</li>
            <li>It did not meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG standards.</a></li>
            <li>It's too laggy.</li>
            <li>SEO was really consistent, meaning some pages would show up on Google and others wouldn't. Or, the SEO would just be outdated at times and pages would have incorrect titles / names.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With this website rebuild I hope to solve as much of these issues as possible.</p>
            <h2 class="questions">Will the artworks / articles / store be back?</h2>
            <p>I intend to restore full functionality of the original website, so yes. Priority at the moment is as follows: <strong>website structure + functionality > back-end > styling (aesthetics + animation).</strong> In other words, this website might be super plain for quite the time.</p>
            <h2 class="questions">How long will it take?</h2>
            <p>Honestly have no idea, just depends on when I feel like it haha. But rest assured this site has not been abandoned.</p>
