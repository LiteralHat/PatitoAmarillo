                            <p>All my work - this website, my art, animations, music, EVERYTHING - is merely a
                                hobby.</p>

                            <p>I'm a one man team trying to have the most fun as possible.</p>

                            <p>If you would like to support me, <b>don't show my stuff to your friends, don't
                                    like
                                    and subscribe,</b> just sit back and take the time to enjoy my work. See how
                                long you can go without telling anyone about LiteralHat.</p>

                            <h2>The Case With Social Media</h2>

                            <p>I don't use social media.</p>
                            <p>I get pressured all the time to make this and that, and make it faster, and it's
                                distressing.</p>
                            <p>Everything posted on my Instagram, Twitter, etc. is done with a script. In other
                                words, all automated and I don't even visit the site.</p>
                            <p>You're free to comment or message but it probably won't be seen. Sorry. But I
                                appreciate you with all my heart.</p>

                            <div class='spacermedium'></div>
                            <h2>My mission</h2>
                            <p>This website is my pride and joy.</p>
                            <p>In the end, my goal is to make it the home of everything I've done.</p>
                            <p>I would appreciate it if you bookmarked LiteralHat.com, and come back sometime.
                            </p>
                            <p>I update it very frequently - Promise I'll try my best to keep it interesting and
                                worthwhile.</p>
